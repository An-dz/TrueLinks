# TrueLinks
A collection of userscripts that remove tracking from Social medias. Released under the MIT license.

When you click over some links on social medias, those websites add a tracking link so they know what websites you are accessing. This info is either used by them or sold to others to sell more tailored ads to you.

If you have enough of all this tracking TrueLinks will try to remove them making you jump directly to the site you want.

TrueLinks is available for the following sites:
* Facebook
* Twitter
