# TrueLinks
A collection of userscripts that remove tracking from Social medias. Released under the MIT license.

When you click over some links on social medias, those websites add a tracking link so they know what websites you are accessing. This info is either used by them or sold to others to sell more tailored ads to you.

If you don't want to be tracked TrueLinks will try to remove them making you jump directly to the site you want.

With TrueLinks those sites will track you less and you'll get to the links much faster as you don't need to download their page first.

The basic version of TrueLinks affects all sites to remove common tracking strategies:
* [Generic](https://github.com/An-dz/TrueLinks/raw/master/TrueLinks.user.js)

But TrueLinks also comes with specific version for some specific sites to remove their more complicated trackers:
* [Facebook](https://github.com/An-dz/TrueLinks/raw/master/TrueFacebookLinks.user.js)
* [Disqus](https://github.com/An-dz/TrueLinks/raw/master/TrueDisqusLinks.user.js)
* [Slack](https://github.com/An-dz/TrueLinks/raw/master/TrueSlackLinks.user.js)
* [Twitter](https://github.com/An-dz/TrueLinks/raw/master/TrueTweetLinks.user.js)

## Installation
You need to install these as UserScripts, so you probably need a browser extension to install them.

You better do a small search on how to install UserScripts into your browser, but basically you install an extension and click on the links above.
